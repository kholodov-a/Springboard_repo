Final Selected Model: K-Neighbors Classification
------------------------------------------------
Hyperparameters:
- Number of Neighbors: 19

Final Features (with Descriptions):
- Month: The month of the year when the flight occurred (1-12).
- Weekday: The day of the week when the flight occurred (0 = Monday, 6 = Sunday).
- Reporting_Airline: The airline responsible for the flight.
- Origin: The origin airport of the flight.
- Dest: The destination airport of the flight.
- DepTimeBlk: The time block during which the flight departed (e.g., "0600-0659").
- ArrTimeBlk: The time block during which the flight arrived (e.g., "0600-0659").

Model Objective:
- Classification

Performance Metrics:
- F1-macro score (Training): 0.073963
- F1-macro score (Test): 0.056446

Additional Notes:
- The continuous target variable 'ActArrDelay' was discretized into 14 classes (0 to 13), each representing a range of arrival delays.
- The class distribution was imbalanced, requiring the use of metrics like F1-macro to ensure fair evaluation across all classes.
